## Quick Start Instructions

### What I Need From You:
1. **GitHub Repository URL** - The link to your repo
2. **Requirements Document** - Upload your PDF/document to the repo that contains:
   - Project specifications
   - Feature requirements
   - UI/UX mockups or descriptions
   - Technical requirements

### What I'll Do:
1. **Fetch your entire repository** and analyze:
   - Current codebase structure
   - Existing components and functionality
   - Dependencies and configuration
   - Database schema (if any)

2. **Read your requirements document** to understand:
   - What needs to be built
   - Expected functionality
   - Design specifications
   - Technical constraints

3. **Provide immediate development** based on:
   - Your existing code foundation
   - Requirements from your document
   - Best practices for your tech stack

### Expected Repository Structure Analysis:
- `/src` - Source code
- `/components` - React components
- `/pages` - Page components
- `/types` - TypeScript definitions
- `/services` or `/api` - API service layers
- `package.json` - Dependencies
- Any config files (vite, tailwind, etc.)

### What I'll Look For:
- ✅ Current authentication system
- ✅ Routing setup
- ✅ Component architecture
- ✅ State management approach
- ✅ Styling system (CSS modules, Tailwind, etc.)
- ✅ API integration patterns
- ❌ Missing features to implement
- ❌ Required components to build
- ❌ Database/API endpoints needed

## Ready? 
Just provide:
1. Your GitHub repo URL
2. Confirm your requirements document is uploaded to the repo
3. I'll analyze everything and start building immediately!
